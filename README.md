#### 1️⃣ Ask Single Questions
```
❓ Ask AI: explain difference btw quantum and normal computer
```

#### 2️⃣ Batch Mode
```
❓ Ask AI: batch

📋 Batch Mode - Enter questions (empty line to finish):
  Question 1: what is machine learning
  Question 2: explain neural networks
  Question 3: [press Enter to finish]
```

#### 3️⃣ Save Results
```
❓ Ask AI: save
Filename [ai_responses.json]: my_research.json
```

#### 4️⃣ Exit
```
❓ Ask AI: quit
```

## 📋 Example Output

## 🎯 Best Practices for Educational Use

### Crafting Good Questions
✅ **Good**: "explain the difference between photosynthesis and cellular respiration"
✅ **Good**: "compare SQL and NoSQL databases with examples"
❌ **Avoid**: "tell me everything about biology"

### Using Results Ethically
- ✅ Use as a **learning aid** and **starting point** for research
- ✅ **Verify information** from multiple sources
- ✅ **Cite properly** when using in academic work
- ✅ Use for **understanding concepts**, not replacing critical thinking
- ❌ Don't copy-paste as your own work
- ❌ Don't rely solely on AI for important decisions

### Maximizing Learning
1. **Ask follow-up questions** - Dive deeper into topics
2. **Compare sources** - Cross-reference with textbooks and papers
3. **Take notes** - Don't just save, actively engage with the content
4. **Experiment** - Try different question formats to see what works best

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Script won't find AI input box
- ✅ Check `ai_mode_page.html` and `ai_mode_debug.png` saved in your folder
- ✅ Try running in non-headless mode (`n`) to see what's happening
- ✅ Make sure you're logged into Google Chrome

### No response or cut-off answers
- ✅ Increase wait times in the script if you have slow internet
- ✅ Try running again - sometimes Google's page loads slowly
- ✅ Check if Google is showing CAPTCHA (run in non-headless mode)

### Headless mode fails
- ✅ The script now has enhanced anti-detection! Should work smoothly
- ✅ If it still fails, screenshots are auto-saved for debugging
- ✅ Try updating Chrome and chromedriver

## 📁 Output Files

The script generates several files:

- `ai_responses.json` - Your saved Q&A sessions (structured JSON)
- `ai_mode_page.html` - Debug file when something goes wrong
- `ai_mode_debug.png` - Screenshot for debugging headless mode
- `ai_mode_error.png` - Screenshot when errors occur

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- Google may rate-limit excessive requests
- The script includes random delays (10-20s) between batch questions
- Don't abuse the service - use responsibly!
